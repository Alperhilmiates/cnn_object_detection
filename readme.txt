For a project led by Ar&Tecs for EU, I proposed a pest detection model that uses open source tools for fully automated farming. 
The model is capable of detecting the four most common pests in aquaponics, hydroponics, and conventional styles of agriculture. 
During training, the model was trained on close-up images of pests and relatively distant shots. 
Segmentation of 1,000 images was done during training, with 200 images being labeled manually and the rest being labeled with the assistance of an automated recognition model for TrainYOLO, 
which was then manually corrected.
Highlights:
✅ Video tracking is possible and accurate.
✅ Decay on pest results as remaining parts can also be detected and classified.
✅ Satisfactory results were obtained with pests of relatively different sizes, ranging from x10 to x1000 size differences between types.
✅ For high-resolution images, tiling used to obtain more accurate results, requiring very little human support after training is completed.
